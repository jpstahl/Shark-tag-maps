# Shark-tag-maps

Purpose

To map shark tag release and popoff locations for those tagged in Hawaii and American Samoa fisheries.

There is code for a reference map if main map is zoomed in to Hawaii or American Samoa fisheries.

Problems 

Scalebar 

Needs work. There is issues with this code as I think the package is old. 

North arrow

Needs work. There is some issues with this code as the north arrow displays but error may not be meaningful.

EEZ 

Needs work. There is some issues with this code as I think the original package is old.
